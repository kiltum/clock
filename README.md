H1 Project Clock

This project was inspired by some reasons:
1. Surprise, I need another clock for my home.
2. I dont like any available clocks, so I need brand new.  
3. I want do something, that looks like electronic equipment from 80x. You know, that chips in DIP packages, red boards, rainbow wires and other stuff like this. No SMD, no BGA, only old school!

H2 What should do my clock

1. Show current time. 
2. Dont make me blind at my night wake-ups.
3. Do something to make time accurate and safe from power line cuts.

H2 What clock should do too. May be not all at once ...

1. Meashure CO2 level
2. Work as pomodoro timer
3. Play music or internet-radio
4. Show me weather conditions. 
5. Work as remote display. Why not? Sometimes I need to display some number and track it 
6. Work as phone charger. Qi? Or USB - I dont known best solution yet. 
7. Work as intellectual reminder/alarm.
